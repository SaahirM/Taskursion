# Taskursion (WIP)

By: [SaahirM](https://github.com/SaahirM)

## Description
A task-tracking web app with the ability to organize tasks into endless layers of subtasks. This is just a personal project.

## Prerequisites
To get a demo of this project running on your local device, you will need:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

1. If you're on Windows, run `MAIN.bat` to start a local server and launch the app on a new browser window

1. Otherwise, you can also run the app by starting the server manually:
	1. Start a command terminal here
	1. Type

		```
		node server.js
		```
	1. Then navigate to this address using a browser

		```
		http://127.0.0.1:2048
		```
